# Discord Bot Token Guide

## The Issue
Your Discord bot is not working because the token format in your `.env` file is incorrect.

## How to Fix It

### 1. Get Your Valid Bot Token
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your application
3. Go to the "Bot" tab
4. Click "Reset Token" or view your existing token
5. Copy the new token

### 2. Update Your .env File
Replace the current token with your new one in `.env`:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

### What a Discord Bot Token Looks Like
Discord tokens have a specific format, typically:
- Long string (59-70+ characters)
- Contains letters, numbers, and symbols
- Usually starts with a common pattern

Example format (not a real token):
`ODk4OTc3NjY4NDQ5MTU5MTY4.YWti5Q.AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz`

### Security Note
- Never share your bot token publicly
- If you've accidentally exposed your token, reset it immediately
- Don't commit your `.env` file to public repositories
